> Demo on how to build and train DCGAN model with MXNet and its R frontend.  

The demo is made of the two following scripts: 

- `DCGAN_mnist_setup.R`: prepare data and define model structure
- `DCGAN_train.R`: execute the training

Custom iterators are also defined in `iterators.R` and imported by `DCGAN_mnist_setup.R`. 

It also requires to have MNIST dataset (available through [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/digit-recognizer/data)) in `/data/` folder. 

*** 

A Generative Adversial Model trains simultaneously two models: a generator that learns to output fake samples from an unknown distribution and a discriminator that learns to distinguish fake from real samples. 

In the conditinal variation of the GAN, the generator is instructed to generate a real sample having specific characteristics rather than a generic sample. Such condition could be the label associated with an image or a more detailed tag as shown in the example below:

## Generator 

Network that build target objects (MNIST images) from 2 components:  
- Noise vector  
- The labels defining the object condition (which digit to produce)

The noise vector will provide the building blocks to the Generator model, which will learns how to structure that noise into a sample. 

The information on the label for which to generate a fake sample is provided by a one-hot encoding of the label that is appended to the random noise. 

```{r, include=FALSE}
require(imager)
require(dplyr)
require(mxnet)
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}

D_sym<- mx.symbol.load(file.name = "models/D_sym_model_A1.json")
G_sym<- mx.symbol.load(file.name = "models/G_sym_model_A1.json")

```

## Discriminator

A model that attempt to distinguish a real sample from a fake one produced by the generator model. 

In a conditional GAN, the label associated with the samples are also provided to the Discriminator. In this demo, this information is again provided a a hot-hot encoding of the label that has been broadcasted to match the image dimensions (28x28).

## Training process

The training process of the discriminator is most obvious: the loss is simple a binary TRUE/FALSE response and that loss is propagated back into the CNN network. It can therefore be understood as simple a binary classification problem. 

```{r, eval=F}
### Train loop on fake
mx.exec.update.arg.arrays(exec_D, arg.arrays = list(data=D_data_fake, digit=D_digit_fake, label=mx.nd.array(rep(0, batch_size))), match.name=TRUE)
mx.exec.forward(exec_D, is.train=T)
mx.exec.backward(exec_D)
update_args_D<- updater_D(weight = exec_D$ref.arg.arrays, grad = exec_D$ref.grad.arrays)
mx.exec.update.arg.arrays(exec_D, update_args_D, skip.null=TRUE)

### Train loop on real
mx.exec.update.arg.arrays(exec_D, arg.arrays = list(data=D_data_real, digit=D_digit_real, label=mx.nd.array(rep(1, batch_size))), match.name=TRUE)
mx.exec.forward(exec_D, is.train=T)
mx.exec.backward(exec_D)
update_args_D<- updater_D(weight = exec_D$ref.arg.arrays, grad = exec_D$ref.grad.arrays)
mx.exec.update.arg.arrays(exec_D, update_args_D, skip.null=TRUE)
```

The generator loss come from the backprogation of the the discriminator loss into it's generated output. By faking the generator labels to be real samples into the discriminator, the discriminator back-propagated loss provides the generator with the information on how to best adapt its parameters to trick the discriminator into believing the fake samples are real. 

This requires to backpropagate the gradients up to the input data of the discriminator (whereas this input gradient is typically ignored in vanilla feedforward network). 

```{r, eval=F}
### Update Generator weights - use a seperate executor for writing data gradients
exec_D_back<- mxnet:::mx.symbol.bind(symbol = D_sym, arg.arrays = exec_D$arg.arrays, aux.arrays = exec_D$aux.arrays, grad.reqs = rep("write", length(exec_D$arg.arrays)), ctx = devices)

mx.exec.update.arg.arrays(exec_D_back, arg.arrays = list(data=D_data_fake, digit=D_digit_fake, label=mx.nd.array(rep(1, batch_size))), match.name=TRUE)
mx.exec.forward(exec_D_back, is.train=T)
mx.exec.backward(exec_D_back)
D_grads<- exec_D_back$ref.grad.arrays$data
mx.exec.backward(exec_G, out_grads=D_grads)

update_args_G<- updater_G(weight = exec_G$ref.arg.arrays, grad = exec_G$ref.grad.arrays)
mx.exec.update.arg.arrays(exec_G, update_args_G, skip.null=TRUE)
```

The above training steps are executed in the `DCGAN_train.R` script.
